	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<img src="img/waymon.jpg" width="300" height="300"/>

	<p>For several years I worked jobs that were tolerable enough to report to every day and paid enough to cover the
		bills
		but didn't allow for me to use my greatest strengths.
		From food service to customer service - from working with kids to lawn care: you name it, I've done it.
		No matter what type of work that I've done over the years, there has always been a common theme that I keep
		coming back to:
		<strong>I wish that I could make things better here!</strong>
		That steady desire to want to make things better for business and people lead me to a career as a web developer!
	</p>

	<h2><strong>HELPING BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE THRIVE IS MY COFFEE!</strong></h2>
